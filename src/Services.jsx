              appealing, user-friendly, and responsive interfaces. With a keen
              eye for design and a deep understanding of user experience
              principles, I conduct user research to ensure products are both
              functional and engaging across all devices. I combine technical
              expertise with user-centered design to deliver experiences that

              I specialize in building robust and scalable server-side
              applications using Node.js and Express.js. With expertise in
              database management through MongoDB, I ensure efficient data
              handling and security. I focus on creating APIs that are both
              performant and secure, delivering seamless integration with
              front-end systems. My goal is to build backend solutions that are
              reliable, maintainable, and scalable.
