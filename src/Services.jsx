              Iâ€™m a passionate frontend developer focused on creating visually
              appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I have a keen eye for
              design and a deep understanding of user experience principles. I
              conduct user research. I combine technical expertise with
              user-centered design. This allows me to develop products that are
              not only visually stunning but also highly functional and
              engaging.
